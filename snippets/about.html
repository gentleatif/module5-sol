  <h2 class="mx-auto">About This Website</h2>
  <br />
  <p>
    It may be hard to tell, but this website does much more than just help you
    choose a delicious dish from this cozy little restaurant. The website of
    this restaurant has served over 100,000 students all over the world (and
    counting), teaching them the skills of how to develop a website from
    scratch.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    The development of this website was part of the curriculum of 2 Coursera.org
    courses: HTML, CSS, and Javascript for Web Developers and Single Page Web
    Applications with AngularJS. All courses have an option to be taken for
    free.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    As of November, 2016, both courses made it to the #1 Top Rated Course spot
    (among close to 1,800 available courses).
  </p>

  <p>
    The courses and this site was not a labor of just one person. We owe a debt
    of gratitute to:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Moshe Chaikin of StoryWithLight.com, who not only filmed and produced the
      Field Trip video (featured above), but also provided food photography so
      the users of the site can see a picture of each dish.
    </li>
    <br />
    <li>Kalman Hazins, who coded the backend service for this website.</li>
    <br />
    <li>
      Finally, the owners of David Chu's China Bistro restaurant who graciously
      agreed to assist us in this project.
    </li>
  </ul>
